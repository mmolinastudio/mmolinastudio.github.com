<p>I hope this is only a short rest at home. This sunny morning with a little hangover I&#39;m going to try to summarise my trip alone in UK. Nothing in these memorable last weeks has been as I had imagined before.</p>
<p>Well, last time I wrote I was in the farm. After being there for ten days I left to Nottingham, passing by Petersborough where I had enough time to visit the Cathedral where Catalina De Arag√≥n was buried. Even though I found nice places in these cities, I didn&#39;t like them and after one day I went to the North. For five days I was in Newcastle upon Tyne and I fell in love with the city. I would have stayed up there for a long time but I also wanted to continue my way and finally I left to Glasgow for being there another six days. It looks a cruel city when you arrive, it is much better when you walk the streets and the University area and discover really good places, and it still looks hard after all. It&#39;s easy to imagine why so many rock bands were born in Glasgow.</p>
<p>Now that I look back, I realize what have been the best moments. Reviewing pictures I&#39;m remembering wonderful buildings, bridges, main streets, narrow lanes, pubs, parks, museums... but with no doubt, the photos I like the most are those that remind me the people I met and those great moments with them. Moments like drinking at 4am with people from Edinburgh under the Swing Bridge of Newcastle, discovering Glasgow with a Philippine girl from NY or with two friends of my brother who are living there, enjoying Eels in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, living lots of moments in the farm or enjoying the nightlife of Liverpool and Newcastle with many other good people.</p>
<p>This Is the first time I travel alone outside Spain and the experience has teached me many things. For example that you can move very easily around UK by coach (lower cost than train) with National Express (it works much better than the spanish companies), or how to ride a horse or milk a goat, or why you shouldn&#39;t work with horses with flip-flops (experienced in my own foot), or how to cook a Paella in UK (or destroy it), or where you can find free wifi,... and of course, more English words.</p>
<p>This days I&#39;m seeing family and friends and enjoying the &quot;Hogueras&quot;, and after that, probably I will begin to look for a job in Dublin, Amsterdam or London, meanwhile I will be learning and refreshing more javascript.</p>
<p>When I know something, I will write again.</p>
